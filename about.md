**I'm an internationally-minded student, pilot, and polyglot currently living in Chicago**. When I'm not studying Economics and Geography, I'm most likely out flying, practicing my French & German, or cooking for myself and others. Read more about me below! 

### My Bilingual Academic Background
I was born and raised in San Francisco, where I attended a French-American bilingual school. From kindergarten to high school, all of my coursework was taught in French using a curriculum that valued academic rigor and fostered critical thinking skills. This is where I was first introduced to Geography. 

All in all, I took Geography for seven years total starting in middle school. This is where I learned about global geography, with a focus on France, Europe, and the United States. After graduating from this bilingual school, I started as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago. 

Since moving to Chicago in 2017, I've followed my passion for Geography by pursuing two B.As, one in *Geographical Sciences* and another in *Economics*.

### My Passions outside of the Classroom
I'm a pilot and member of a small flying club out of Lansing, IL. We operate a well-equipped four-seat Cessna 172P used for both pleasure flights and primary training. I usually fly about once every two weeks. 

One of my favorite flight routes is along the Chicago shoreline, where the view of the skyscrapers downtown is beautiful! I also enjoy flying in the beautiful Bay Area when I am visiting my hometown. See some cool videos [here](../construction).

I also love to travel both in my local Chicago area and around the world. Having recently moved to Chicago, I often explore different parts of the city on weekends by myself and with friends. During longer vacations, I travel to all corners of the world.

I'm fortunate to have visited many different countries over 15+ years of traveling. I regularly visit my extended family in Switzerland and El Salvador, and I've also been to many other countries from France to the UK, Ethiopia to Laos and more.
