Recently, I've worked on spatial analysis projects to solve transportation, health, and sustainable development problems. In each project, I used my GIS skills to show meaningful spatial correlations, patterns, and trends in large datasets. 

I'm experienced at using open-source spatial technologies to interpret and visualize insights in spatial data. In the past, I've used QGIS to create static maps from spatial data layers, PostGIS to store large spatial datasets, and R to perform powerful statistical analyses. 

Along the way, I also learned high leverage database querying skills with SQL, and enterprise level data standardization & quality assurance techniques. These skills allow me to navigate complex GIS data collection, processing, and storage workflows. 

Below is a brief introduction to the exciting personal and academic projects I'm currently working on.
